# API of the EMMA Mobility Management Platform

# Project Description
EMMA is a web-based application designed and developed by 5T on behalf of Regione Piemonte: 
it helps the Mobility Manager to draw up the Sustainable Mobility Plan which aims to reduce the negative impacts of commuting trips. 
It is a web application, composed by a backend (this repository - written in PHP using the CakePHP frameworkd) and a frontend (EMMA-Vue, written in Vue.js 2.0).
The backend is a REST API, which provides all the necessary functions to run the application.
The frontend is a Single Page Application, which consumes the REST API.

# Prerequisites
You need a running LAMPP server with PHP 7.2+, MySQL or MariaDB, Apache or Nginx

# Configurations
- The software is multidomain and multiconfiguration (following the Drupal convention).
- Copy a settings_example.php in settings.php, and adapt it to your settings (in particular username and passwords of the db)
- The basic configuration is in the folder /config/sites/default/settings.php
- Configurations which are relevant for a specific domain can be found in the folder /config/sites/{domain}/settings.php
- The settings.php file is well documented and contains all the necessary information to configure the application

# Deployment
- Be sure you have is a running LAMPP environment (see cakephp4 requirements - https://book.cakephp.org/4/en/installation.html)
- Create a schema database, importing db/init.sql
- Put the name of the db in settings.php
- Be sure that the folders /webroot /tmp /logs have full write access from the web server (sudo chmod -R 777)
- Adapt the measures.php and pascal.php if needed
- Run ``composer update`` in the root folder in order to get all the dependencies
- Connect to your webserver and see the login page https://api.emma.test/
- You should see the login page.
- Be sure that the fronend url (the url from which the application is connected from the frontend is configured in the settings.php file)
- After testing, remember to set debug=false in your configure/sites/default/settings.php

## Docker Deployment
- In the root folder you find a Dockerfile which should help you to setup the environment.
